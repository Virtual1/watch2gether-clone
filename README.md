<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I made this project because there are no good Watch2Gether / Youtube Video Synchronize Website Clones out there with that many features. Also I wanted to challenge  myself, test my Node.js and Socket.io skills and see what you can improve or build out of it.
